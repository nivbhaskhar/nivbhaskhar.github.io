Hello there! My name is Nivedita Bhaskhar and I am a Machine Learning Engineer.

I'm interested in machine learning, mathematics, data science and tech. In my past avatar as a mathematician, I worked with mathematical structures called _algebraic groups_. To know more about my work, check out my [research](/research_math) and [portfolio](/portfolio) pages and my expository [tech-blog](/blog).
