# An overview
{: style="background-color: pink"}
In this project, we implement the Blossom algorithm in python to construct maximum matchings in _any_ undirected graph. We also write down unit tests to test the various functions in the algorithm. Finally, we show input outputs for a few example cases for the overall algorithm.
